# matplotlib_challenge

* In this challenge, a set of data for a trial of cancer drug treatments was given to be cleaned and examined and reported in a manner which can be more quickly and easily referenced and interpretted.
 
## Observations and Insights

After analyzing the Pymaceuticals data, several considerations can be made, including the following:

* Mouse ID l509 is an example of mouse treated by Capomulin, the tumor volume has a negative slope and tends to decrease over time

* the bar graph related to mice by drug regimen shows 10 treatments in the study. If the total number of data points for each drug regimen was greater than 100, the highest number of studies is treated with Capomulin

* The study via the pie plot shows an almost identical number of male and female mice

* The correlation between mouse weight and mean tumor volume is 0.84. This is a strong positive correlation, as mouse weight increases, mean tumor volume also increases at an almost proportional rate.The R-squared value is 0.709, which means 70% the model fit the data, wich is fairely good to predict the data from the model.
